        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  - Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham is a paper addressing the importance of data tidying. Data tidying ensures that the dataset follows the structure of having each variable as a column, each observation as a row, and each observational unit as a table. The paper emphasizes the advantages of this structure.\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  - The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to develop a standardized dataset structure or way to organize data values to facilitate more efficient data exploration and analysis. The aim is to prevent analysts from needing to revisit data cleaning each time they pose a new question.\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\"\n",
        "  - Tidy datasets, because they have the same structure and organization, likely only require the same steps of data cleaning. Messy datasets have a variety of different steps required for data cleaning, as the structure is not uniform, and cleaning can depend on the exact questions being asked.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "  What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "  - Defining variables and observations can be challenging if it seems as if a relationship exists between variables. The paper provides the example of height and width as columns/variables. This can be confusing because height and width could also be two values of a different variable: dimension.\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "  - A value is a number or string that makes up a dataset. Values belong to a variable and an observation.\n",
        "  - A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (ex. height, temp, duration). Variables are best represented as columns.\n",
        "  - An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (ex. person, day, race) and is best represented as a row.\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "  - Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure: variable = column, observation = row, observational unit = table.\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets?\n",
        "  - Column headers are values, not variable names\n",
        "  - Multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "  - Variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "  - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "  - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Why are the data in Table 4 messy?\n",
        "  - There are 3 variables (region, income, frequency), yet there are 7 columns (religion, <$10k, $10-20k, $20-30k, $30-40k, $40-50k, $50-75k). The variables are not best represented in this way.\n",
        "\n",
        "  What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "  - Turning the columns of a dataset into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  - The columns in table 11 are id, year, month, element, and d1-d31 for every possible day in a month. Table 12 molten data removed the d1-31 columns and changed these values to rows. Tidy data in table 12 has id, date, tmax, and tmin as variables/columns.\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "  - The chicken-and-egg problem: If tidy date is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inexplicably linked to tidy data. Wickham hopes that others will build on this framework of data cleaning to develop even better storage strategies and tools."
